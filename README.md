# Chat GPT Text Divider

## About
This is a tool designed to help users work within the input restrictions of the OpenAI Chat GPT model. With the input limit set by Chat GPT, large pieces of text cannot be inputted at once. To overcome this challenge, this tool helps to divide larger text into smaller, manageable pieces. This way, users can simply copy and paste each part into the Chat GPT input sequentially.

Additionally, the tool labels each part which allows for easy reference and helps the Chat GPT model to maintain context and coherence over the entire document.

## How to Use
1. **Prompt**: Input a prompt that is used to label each part of the divided text.
2. **Number of words per division**: Input the number of words you want each divided part to consist of. The default is set at 1000 words.
3. **Text**: Input the large text that you want to divide.
4. Click on the "Divide" button to divide your text. Each divided part will appear in its own text box below, prefixed with your prompt and the part number.

## Key Features
- **Text Division**: Divides large pieces of text into smaller parts based on user-defined word count.
- **Copy Buttons**: Easy-to-use 'Copy' buttons for each divided part to facilitate copying and pasting into Chat GPT.
- **Part Identification**: Each part is labeled with the part number out of the total number of parts, helping with easy reference and maintaining coherence.
